        <p>Python is a powerful, high-level programming language that's known for being easy to read and simple to
            write. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991, and today it's one of the most widely used
            languages in the world.</p><br>
        <p>Python is used in many fields, some of which include:</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Web Development</li>
            <li>Data Analysis</li>
            <li>Automation</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Game Development</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Its clean and intuitive syntax makes it a top choice for people who are just starting out with coding. Unlike
            some other languages, Python does not require semicolons or complex curly brace blocks, making it feel more
            like writing in plain English.</p>
        <p>Here's what a basic Python program looks like:</p>
        <pre><code># A simple program that prints a message
print("Hello, world!")</code></pre>
        <p>Just one line of code, and you've written your first Python program.</p><br>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Variables_and_Data_Types">
        <header><h2>Variables and Data Types</h2></header>
        <p>In Python, variables are used to store data, and you don't need to explicitly declare their type. Python
            figures it out based on the value you assign. This makes it easy to write quick, flexible code without
            having to worry about too much syntax up front.

            <br><br>

            Here are some common data types:</p>
        <pre><code>name = "Alice"        # String
age = 30              # Integer
height = 1.75         # Float
is_student = True     # Boolean
</code></pre>
        <p>You can use these variables to perform actions or print them out:</p>
        <code>print(name, "is", age, "years old.")</code>
        <p>Python also supports dynamic typing, meaning you can change the type of a variable later in your code (though
            it's generally good practice to avoid that to keep things clear).</p><br>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Control_Flow:_if,_elif,_else">
        <header><h2>Control Flow: if, elif, else</h2></header>
        <p>Control flow lets your program make decisions. In Python, the <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, and <code>else</code>
            statements are used to run different blocks of code depending on certain conditions. This is one of the most
            essential features in programming.</p>
        <pre><code>temperature = 18

if temperature > 25:
    print("It's hot outside.")
elif temperature > 15:
    print("It's a pleasant day.")
else:
    print("It's a bit chilly.")
</code></pre>
        <p>Indentation is critical in Python. It tells the interpreter which lines belong to which blocks. If you forget
            to indent properly, the program will raise an error or behave unexpectedly.</p><br>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Loops_and_Iteration">
        <header><h2>Loops and Iteration</h2></header>
        <p>Sometimes, you want to repeat a certain block of code multiple times, that's where loops come in. Python
            offers two main types: <code>for</code> loops and <code>while</code> loops.

            A <code>for</code> loop is commonly used when you know in advance how many times you want to run something:
        </p>
        <pre><code>for i in range(5):
    print("Loop number:", i)
</code></pre>
        <p>This will output the numbers 0 to 4, each on a new line.

            A <code>while</code> loop continues running as long as a certain condition is true:</p>
        <pre><code>count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Counting:", count)
    count += 1
</code></pre>
        <p>Use loops to process lists, repeat tasks, or even wait for user input. Just be careful — a while loop with a
            condition that never becomes false will run forever!</p><br>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Functions_and_Reusability">
        <header><h2>Functions and Reusability</h2></header>
        <p>Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help keep your code organized and reusable.
            You define a function using the <code>def</code> keyword, give it a name, and then write the block of code
            it should run.

            Here's an example:</p>
        <pre><code>def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

greet("Sam")
greet("Frodo")
</code></pre>
        <p>This prints a personalized greeting for each name you pass in.

            Functions can also return values, which makes them extremely powerful:</p>
        <pre><code>def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

product = multiply(3, 4)
print("The result is:", product)
</code></pre>
        <p>As your programs get larger, functions become essential for keeping things modular and easier to
            understand.</p>
